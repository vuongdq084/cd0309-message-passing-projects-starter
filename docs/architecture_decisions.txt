I- ANALYSING
1-Client Side:
	- User Device: sends location data with a very high frequency when the user is constantly moving
	- Frontend Web: just need to request static data at rest.
2-Server Side:
	- Storing location data must be prioritized for fast reception and transmission, and data loss must be avoided at all costs.
	- Person and Connection belong to two different business domains. Person is master data that changes less frequently, while Connection is transactional data.\

II-DECISION
- Separate Backend monolith architecture style into microservice by services:
	- Location Service: Receives data via gRPC to optimize communication speed, the push the record to message broker (Kafka topic) to avoid losing data with a high loading.
	- Kafka TOPIC: a component of kafka, to hold interim data between service
	- Location consummer - a consumer, polls data from the TOPIC and writes to Database
	- Person Service - a service which manages person data, expose RestAPI method for FrontEnd and Connection Service to access
	- Location Service - a service provice connection data of person via RestAPI methods.
